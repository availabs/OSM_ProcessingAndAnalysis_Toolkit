# ShstBuilder

> The SharedStreets Builder application converts OpenStreetMap data to
> SharedStreets protocol buffer tiles.

This module uses the [sharedstreets-builder](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-builder)
to create SharedStreets tile sets. These tilesets are used by the
[sharedstreets-js](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-js) application
to match GIS data to the
[SharedStreets Reference System](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-ref-system).

The current SharedStreets Builder version is 3.2.0.
As of December 29, 2021, this is the latest published
[release](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-builder/releases).
